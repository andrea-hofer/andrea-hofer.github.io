Such discriminatory practices were outlawed in different states at different times, culminating in national anti-discrimination legislation targeted at financial institutions in 1975. Exploiting the staggered introduction of these laws across states and over time, I find that independent access to financial services increased married women’s labor force participation by 4-7.5 ppt. To analyze the effects on household bargaining and divorce, I build a life-cycle model with endogenous divorce, female labor force participation, and savings decisions. Relative to a standard collective model of household bargaining, I introduce two additions: a norm cost the husband faces when his wife works, and a share of labor income that the wife can hide from the husband and use at her discretion. After calibrating the model to the US labor market in 1970, it is able to replicate the increase in female labor supply after granting women access to independent financial services. Finally, I use the model to study the effects of women’s independent control over finances on divorce and find that the probability to be divorced 12 years after marriage increases by 4.6 ppt.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5c7124cf4acc28a9732550c2dd16208a","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/womensfinancialliberation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/womensfinancialliberation/","section":"research","summary":"Granting married women more control over their own resources increases their likelihood to participate in the labor market significantly.","tags":null,"title":"A Purse of Her Own: Married Women's Access to Financial Services and Female Labor Supply","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have taught the following courses:\n teaching assistant for the PhD course “Mathematical methods for Microeconomics” (lecturer: Andreas Hefti) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Market Design” (lecturer: Marek Pycia) teaching assistant for the course “Intorduction to Microeconomics” (lecturer: Ernst Fehr) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Introduction to Macroeconomics” (lecturer: Christian Hepenstrick) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Introduction to Game Theory” (lecturer: Samuel Haefner)  I designed the following teaching materials for the Economic Education Program of the Swiss National Bank:\n “How to invest and trade online” “The economics behind Big Tech companies”  Excerpts from student evaluations:\n“Highly motivated and competent TA”\n“Very structured and clear presentations.

We exploit the cultural divide at the Swiss language border which separates German from French speaking municipalities to show that cultural values are an important determinant for unemployment take up. French-speakers–who hold cultural values associated with lower stigma towards unemployment benefit take up– are consistently more likely to apply for unemployment benefits within the first six months after job loss. This result holds also for workers who live on different sides of the language border but who were employed at the same firm before job loss.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d335a3cfafa0d4aa9a515ff43691b945","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/unemployment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/unemployment/","section":"research","summary":"Does stigma decrease unemployment benefit uptake?

In this paper, we show that mothers? labor force participation declines following a labor market shock that reduces the availability of part-time jobs, while men and women without children remain unaffected. We examine an immigration reform that markedly increased the supply of full-time workers in a pre-defined set of border localities in Switzerland. Using social security registers and business census data covering the universe of establishments in a difference-in-differences design, we show that the reform leads to a drop in mothers? labor force participation by 3.2 percentage points. We provide evidence that mothers? drop-out is primarily driven by changes in the structure of local labor markets with firms reducing their demand for part-time workers following the reform. The main channel of competition with immigrant labor in our setting thus manifests itself through the number of hours that workers are willing to supply. Our results are consistent with low hours constituting a job-specific amenity that may be costly for firms to provide.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"74181d979316e201ebfc94d4e65d489d","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/womenimmigration/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/womenimmigration/","section":"research","summary":" In this paper, we show that mothers' labor force participation declines following a labor market shock that reduces the availability of part-time jobs, while fathers and women without children remain unaffected.

The reform of the law comprised multiple measures to foster the equality between husband and wife within the marriage. The Swiss people voted on the reform in a referendum in 1985, accepting the new marital law. Hence at the time of the vote, it was revealed that the Swiss people hold more liberal attitudes than those represented by the old version of the law.

For our analyses, we classify municipalities into conservative and liberal municipalities depending on the referendum voting results in the municipality. Overall, we find that from 1988 on, i.e., after the new marital law has been implemented, married women in conservative municipalities are catching up with married women in liberal municipalities in terms of labor force participation in the first year after getting married. We do not see a strong direct response of married women’s employment in conservative relative to liberal municipalities between 1985 and 1988, i.e., after the referendum revealed relatively more liberal national norms of the Swiss people than what has been represented by the old marital law but prior to the law change.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0812cf3b40ce52d354d522802ebc3e80","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/normslaws/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/normslaws/","section":"research","summary":"This paper analyses the impact of the modernization of the Swiss marital law in the 1980s on married women's labor force participation in Switzerland.
