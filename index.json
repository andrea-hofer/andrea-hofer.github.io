Such discriminatory practices were outlawed in the US with various credit laws introduced in different states at different times, culminating in the national Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1975. In this paper, I study the consequences of granting married women more control over their own finances due to these law changes empirically and in a structural life-cycle model. I find that giving women full control over their own resources increases their likelihood of participating in the labor market by around 8 p.p. I enhance a standard collective household model in order to replicate my empirical findings. Calibrating the model to the US labor market shows that improving married womens\u0026#39; financial independence contributed about % to the overall increase in female labor supply between 1970 and 1990.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ca5871d5bb96e304736118e52738d952","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/project/womensfinancialliberation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/womensfinancialliberation/","section":"project","summary":"Granting married women full control over their own resources increases likelihood to participate in the labor market by 8 p.p.","tags":null,"title":"A Purse of Her Own: Women's Access to Banking Services and Female Labor Supply","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andreas Beerli","Andrea R.

We find that the gender difference in this age group is driven by young mothers leaving the labor market at higher rates after immigration.
