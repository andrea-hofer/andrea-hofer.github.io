Such discriminatory practices were outlawed in different states at different times, culminating in national anti-discrimination legislation targeted at financial institutions in 1975. Exploiting the staggered introduction of these laws across states and over time, I find that independent access to financial services increased married women?s labor force participation by 4-7.5 ppt. To analyze the effects on household bargaining and divorce, I build a life-cycle model with endogenous divorce, female labor force participation, and savings decisions. Relative to a standard collective model of household bargaining, I introduce two additions: a norm cost the husband faces when his wife works, and a share of labor income that the wife can hide from the husband and use at her discretion. After calibrating the model to the US labor market in 1970, it is able to replicate the increase in female labor supply after granting women access to independent financial services. Finally, I use the model to study the effects of women’s independent control over finances on divorce and find that the probability to be divorced 12 years after marriage increases by 4.2 ppt.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5c7124cf4acc28a9732550c2dd16208a","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/womensfinancialliberation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/womensfinancialliberation/","section":"research","summary":"Granting married women more control over their own resources increases their likelihood to participate in the labor market significantly.","tags":null,"title":"A Purse of Her Own: Married Women's Access to Financial Services and Female Labor Supply","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have taught the following courses:\n teaching assistant for the PhD course “Mathematical methods for Microeconomics” (lecturer: Andreas Hefti) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Market Design” (lecturer: Marek Pycia) teaching assistant for the course “Intorduction to Microeconomics” (lecturer: Ernst Fehr) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Introduction to Macroeconomics” (lecturer: Christian Hepenstrick) teaching assistant for the undergraduate course “Introduction to Game Theory” (lecturer: Samuel Haefner)  I designed the following teaching materials for the Economic Education Program of the Swiss National Bank:\n “How to invest and trade online” “The economics behind Big Tech companies”  Excerpts from student evaluations:\n“Highly motivated and competent TA”\n“Very structured and clear presentations.

We exploit the cultural divide at the Swiss language border which separates German from French speaking municipalities to show that cultural values are an important determinant for unemployment take up. French-speakers–who hold cultural values associated with lower stigma towards unemployment benefit take up– are consistently more likely to apply for unemployment benefits within the first six months after job loss. This result holds also for workers who live on different sides of the language border but who were employed at the same firm before job loss.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d335a3cfafa0d4aa9a515ff43691b945","permalink":"https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/unemployment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/unemployment/","section":"research","summary":"Does stigma decrease unemployment benefit uptake?

We find that the gender difference in this age group is driven by young mothers leaving the labor market at higher rates after immigration.
