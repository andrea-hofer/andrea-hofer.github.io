      <title>Mothers&#39; Labor Supply and Immigration: Evidence from the Swiss Border Opening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does immigration affect native men and women differently? We study the case of the Swiss border opening to workers from the European Union starting in 2002 and show that while the effects do not differ for young or older men and women, there are stark differences for the age group between 30-39. We find that the gender difference in this age group is driven by young mothers leaving the labor market at higher rates after immigration. The dropout rate is largest for mothers who are married to a partner who experienced the largest wage increases due to immigration.&lt;/p&gt;
