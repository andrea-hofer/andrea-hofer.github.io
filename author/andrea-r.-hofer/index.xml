&lt;p&gt;In mid-20th century, US women often faced discrimination when applying for bank accounts or loans in their own names: banks frequently required male co-signers for loans and automatically transferred women&amp;rsquo;s accounts into joint accounts upon marriage. Such discriminatory practices were outlawed in different states at different times, culminating in national anti-discrimination legislation targeted at financial institutions in 1975. Exploiting the staggered introduction of these laws across states and over time, I find that independent access to financial services increased married women&amp;rsquo;s labor force participation by 4-7.5 ppt. To analyze the effects on household bargaining and divorce, I build a life-cycle model with endogenous divorce, female labor force participation, and savings decisions. Relative to a standard collective model of household bargaining, I introduce two additions: a norm cost the husband faces when his wife works, and a share of labor income that the wife can hide from the husband and use at her discretion. After calibrating the model to the US labor market in 1970, it is able to replicate the increase in female labor supply after granting women access to independent financial services. Finally, I use the model to study the effects of women&amp;rsquo;s independent control over finances on divorce and find that the probability to be divorced 12 years after marriage increases by 4.6 ppt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural Attitudes and Unemployment Benefit Take Up: Evidence from the Swiss Language Border</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/unemployment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does stigma prevent individuals from applying to unemployment benefits even if they are eligible? We exploit the cultural divide at the Swiss language border which separates German from French speaking municipalities to show that cultural values are an important determinant for unemployment take up. French-speakers&amp;ndash;who hold cultural values associated with lower stigma towards unemployment benefit take up&amp;ndash; are consistently more likely to apply for unemployment benefits within the first six months after job loss. This result holds also for workers who live on different sides of the language border but who were employed at the same firm before job loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mothers&#39; Labor Force Participation and the Availability of Part-Time Jobs</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/womenimmigration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does the structure of jobs in the labor market shape mothers&#39; labor supply? In this paper, we show that mothers&#39; labor force participation declines following a labor market shock that reduces the availability of part-time jobs, while fathers and women without children remain unaffected. We leverage an immigration reform that sharply increased the supply of high-skilled, full-time workers in a pre-defined set of border localities in Switzerland. Using social security registers and business census data in a difference-in-differences design, we show that the reform leads to a change in the structure of the labor market with fewer part-time jobs, resulting in a drop in mothers&#39; labor force participation by 4 percentage points. This pattern translates into an increase in the &amp;ldquo;child penalty&amp;rdquo; that persists up to ten years after the birth of the first child. We provide evidence that mothers&#39; drop-out is primarily driven by firms reducing their demand for part-time workers, thus highlighting a competition channel that manifests itself through the number of hours that workers are willing to supply. We rule out alternative mechanisms such as household income effects, fertility, and gender norms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Norms vs. Law Changes: What matters for Female Labor Force Participation?</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/normslaws/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We study whether a signal of a norm change or the actual law change has a larger impact on real world outcomes by looking at a vote on the Swiss marriage law which passed in 1985 (signal), but was only implemented in 1988 (law change). While the old marriage law allowed the husband to prohibit his wife from working, the new law did not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
