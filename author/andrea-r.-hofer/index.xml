wn: Women&#39;s Access to Financial Services and Female Labor Supply</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up until 1975, US women often reported issues when applying for bank accounts or loans in their own names: many banks required male co-signers, essentially granting married womens&#39; husbands access to their accounts. Such discriminatory practices were outlawed in the US with various credit laws introduced in different states at different times, culminating in the national Equal Credit Opportunity Act in 1975. In this paper, I study the consequences of granting married women more control over their own finances due to these law changes empirically and in a structural life-cycle model. I find that giving women full control over their own resources increases their likelihood of participating in the labor market by 4-7.5 p.p. Since a standard collective household bargaining model would predict a decrease in labor supply,  I enhance the standard model two-fold: I introduce a norm cost the husband faces when the wife works as well as a hiding share of labor income which the wife can use purely for her own consumption. I then calibrate the model to the US labor market in 1970 and show that the enhanced model is able to replicate the increase in female labor supply seen in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural Attitudes and Unemployment Benefit Take Up: Evidence from the Swiss Language Border</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/unemployment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does stigma prevent individuals from applying to unemployment benefits even if they are eligible? We exploit the cultural divide at the Swiss language border which separates German from French speaking municipalities to show that cultural values are an important determinant for unemployment take up. French-speakers&amp;ndash;who hold cultural values associated with lower stigma towards unemployment benefit take up&amp;ndash; are consistently more likely to apply for unemployment benefits within the first six months after job loss. This result holds also for workers who live on different sides of the language border but who were employed at the same firm before job loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mothers&#39; Labor Supply and Immigration: Evidence from the Swiss Border Opening</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/womenimmigration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does immigration affect native men and women differently? We study the case of the Swiss border opening to workers from the European Union starting in 2002 and show that while the effects do not differ for young or older men and women, there are stark differences for the age group between 30-39. We find that the gender difference in this age group is driven by young mothers leaving the labor market at higher rates after immigration. The dropout rate is largest for mothers who are married to a partner who experienced the largest wage increases due to immigration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Norms vs. Law Changes: What matters for Female Labor Force Participation?</title>
      <link>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/normslaws/</link>

      <guid>https://andrea-hofer.github.io/research/normslaws/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We study whether a signal of a norm change or the actual law change has a larger impact on real world outcomes by looking at a vote on the Swiss marriage law which passed in 1985 (signal), but was only implemented in 1988 (law change). While the old marriage law allowed the husband to prohibit his wife from working, the new law did not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
